# Letter-To-Myself
## When you are freaking out, read this!

Okay, so at this point you know that coding is much harder than you expected.  But also at this point, you have completed your first goal and graduated from the Intro to Programming course and have acquired several basic skills in coding.  You have the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript down and it's time to start building on what you've learned so far.  When you are in a rut, remember to use your research skills to search the web for help.  Someone out there has had the same problem as you, and there are tons of resources to help you learn.  Also, don't be afraid to ask for help!  It is not a sign of weakness, but of a growth mindset.  Through practice and constant learning, you will get better! Lastly, if Colin tells you to take a break because you are cursing at the computer screen-**do it**.  Walking away and coming back with a clear mind has *always* worked for you.  Have faith that you will soon have your "ah ha" moment!

## Goals!

My goals are simple.  I want to stop serving tables and start a career.  This is my biggest motivator.  Every day that I go to the same exhausting job and every time I miss out on family events, I am motivated to finish this program and start a career.  That being said, I need to stop procrastinating and put in the work!  My goal for the rest of this program is to finish a project every week.  I know it's doable. Another goal I have is to actively start job searching!  Time wasted equals opportunities missed.  Ready, set, **GO**!
